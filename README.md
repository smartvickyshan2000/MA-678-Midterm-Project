# MA-678-Midterm-Project

## Here is Vicky's MA 678 Midterm Project.
Credit card has taken up a significant part of people's lives in the current society. The "Credit Card Customers" dataset is data of the consumer credit card portfolio of a bank, including 10,000 customers with their age, gender, income, marital status, education level, and etc. The manager wants to know the reason behind customer attrition. 

This report aims to deal with this customer attrition problem. I made exploratory data analysis and built a multilevel model, which uses utilizing Education_Level as the varying intercept and Gender as the varying slope. This report are consisted of 5 main parts: Introduction, Method, Result, Discussion, and Limitation. Other explorations besides what in Method part are all put in Appendix.
